# Title: Educational Dice Game Project

## Description:
This repository contains code for an educational dice game project developed for learning purposes. The project aims to demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in the context of building a simple dice game.

# Purpose:
The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience for students and developers interested in web development. By examining and experimenting with the code, learners can gain insights into how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive web applications. Additionally, the project encourages exploration and experimentation, allowing learners to modify and extend the codebase to further their understanding.

> *Note*: This project is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for real gambling activities. Users are encouraged to explore, learn, and experiment responsibly.
